Here are a lot of codes for generating and testing a series of signals:
---
|Sin|Sinusoidal|
|---|---|
|LC|linear chirp|
|SG|sine-Gaussian|
|FM|frequency modulated|
|AM|amplitude modulated|
|AMFM|AM-FM|
|LTC|linear transient chirp|
|EDS|exponentially damped sinusoid|
|SFM|step FM|

The list of signals and their expressions can also see [PDF file](https://github.com/guoxiaowhu/GWSC_NAOC/blob/main/signals/List%20of%20signals.pdf).
