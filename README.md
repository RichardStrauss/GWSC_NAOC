# GWSC_NAOC
Welcome to our repository! This repository is uesd to store some codes for a gravitational wave data analysis school. 
These codes can generate and process signals. They are mainly based on MatLab. 
These MatLab codes are stored under ['signals'](https://github.com/guoxiaowhu/GWSC_NAOC/tree/main/signals), and pictures are stored under ['figs'](https://github.com/guoxiaowhu/GWSC_NAOC/tree/main/figs).
